    "about": " My name is James and I'm a software engineer. I am currently in the midst of working on a chatroom application. My future goal with coding is to create a rogue-lite-card game. \n\n\nWhen I got accepted into pharmacy school, I thought I should be the happiest person on the planet, but when I reflected on my life, I realized that medicine was not my passion. I merely tolerated the notion of medicinal studies. My passion was in creation, not memorization. I loved to create programs, but I was raised in an environment to become a pharmacist. However, I decided to forge a path for myself with programming. What I love about programming is that there isn’t just one way to solve a problem. Freedom is the key idea. There isn’t one answer to everything. \n\n I am a fully-fledged software engineer who has already created multiple full-stack applications. I like to create digital art with programs such as Clip Studio Paint and Aseprite in my free time. When I’m not programming or drawing, I’m writing an interactive fiction game with ChoiceScript.",
